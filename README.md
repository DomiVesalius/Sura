## Documentation
All API endpoints and setup instructions have been documented in the ``docs/`` directory. After following the setup 
instructions, you should be able to ``cd`` into the docs directory and run ``retype watch`` to generate a static site 
containing all documentation. If you prefer, you can also just read the markdown files.
